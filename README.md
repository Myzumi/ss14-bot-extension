# SS14 Discord Bot Extension

This Extension is made for out Public Discord bot, which allows it to access more features for your discord server,
Currently the options without this are really limited. But with this included it allows the bot to access more informations and operate how it should.

## Installation

The simple way to install this is to put the files above in a Seperate Folder inside `Content.Server/Administration/`, You can name the folder "DiscordBot" or anything other.
Just note that this will require manually updating the file when we update or add features to some endpoints

The Suggested way is to add this Github Project as a Submodule to the `Content.Server/Administration/` Path, that way, It will be kept updated overtime and you dont need to merge it everytime with your own fork

## Notes

This Project is not only intended for the Discord bot, You can also utilitize the API with other services if wished. Feature requests are always welcome

I'm not experienced in c# and it might take a bit time to update the extension, please keep calm as i'm trying my best for this :3

## The Bot

The Stated Discord bot is still in development aswell as this extension, please note that the Discord bot **WILL NOT** be open source.
Once its in a stable phase, I will update the description and include a invite for the bot and the support server.
