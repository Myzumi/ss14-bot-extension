# SS14 Discord Bot Extension

This Extension is made for our Public Discord bot, which allows it to access more features for your discord server,
Currently the options without this are really limited. But with this included it allows the bot to access more information and operate how it should.

## Installation

The simple way to install this is to put the files above in a Separate Folder inside `Content.Server/Administration/`, You can name the folder "DiscordBot" or anything other.
Just note that this will require manually updating the file when we update or add features to some endpoints.

The Suggested way is to add this GitHub Project as a Submodule to the `Content.Server/Administration/` Path, that way, It will be kept updated overtime, and you don't need to merge it every time with your own fork

## Notes

This Project is not only intended for the Discord bot, You can also utilize the API with other services if wished. Feature requests are always welcome.

I'm not experienced in c# and it might take a bit of time to update the extension, please keep calm as i'm trying my best for this :3

## The Bot

The Stated Discord bot is still in development as well as this extension, please note that the Discord bot **WILL NOT** be open source.
Once it's in a stable phase, I will update the description and include an invite for the bot and the support server.
